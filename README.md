# Petes-Pike
Peteâ€™s Pike is a logic game in which Pete must reach the mountaintop with the help of his trusty goats. Pieces move horizontally or vertically, but slide off the mountain if no piece blocks their path. If blocked, they stop just before the piece. The game ends when Pete reaches the mountaintop or no valid moves remain.
